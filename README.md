3. Project Description

This project is about creating a cloud-based system that helps police stations in Yaoundé, especially in Nkozoa, share information quickly when a person goes missing. The system connects police stations using a Wide Area Network (WAN) and stores all missing persons data in the cloud, so every station can access the same information in real time.


4. Community Problem
In Nkozoa and other parts of Yaoundé, when a person goes missing, police stations do not get the information quickly. Most communication is done using phone calls, paper files and manual reports. This causes delays, and these delays can reduce the chances of finding the missing person safely.

5. Proposed Solution
My system uses cloud computing to store all missing persons records in one central database. All police stations are connected to this database using a WAN, so once a report is made in one station, it is immediately visible to all others. Alerts are also sent to police officers and, when approved, to the community.

6. Technologies Used

-Cloud computing (central database)

-Wide Area Network (WAN)

-Web-based system

-Mobile alerts

-Basic AI for search suggestions



7. How the System Works


8. A missing person is reported at Nkozoa police station.


9. The officer enters the details into the cloud system.


10. All police stations in Yaoundé receive the alert.


11. Police officers and the community start searching.


12. Updates are added until the person is found.




8. Expected Benefits

-Faster response time

-Better coordination between police stations

-Higher chance of finding missing persons

-Less stress for families

9. Conclusion
This project shows how cloud computing and WAN can help improve public safety in Yaoundé by making police work faster, more connected, and more effective.
